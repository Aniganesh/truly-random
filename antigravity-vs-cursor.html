					<h1 class="post-title">Antigravity vs Cursor: Review after using both for a month</h1>

						<span>Developer Tools</span> • <span>Review</span>

				<article>
					<p>I've been using Cursor over a year now and have used it quite a bit in that time. From its early days when
						the chat felt like an extension tacked on top to now where chat seems to be the primary mode of interaction,
						it's come a long way.</p>
					<p>
						Given the hype around <strong>Antigravity</strong> I decided to use it for a while. I've been so used to my
						workflow
						in Cursor that switching IDEs feels like trying to write with my left hand, but I wanted to see if the grass
						was actually greener; or at least different.
					</p>

					<p>
						Spoiler: It's a mixed bag.
					</p>

					<h2 class="section-heading">The Bad stuff</h2>

					<p>
						The onboarding wasn't exactly the "white glove" experience I was hoping for. I expected it to just pull in
						all
						my VS Code extensions and settings seamlessly, but a bunch of them failed to import. The worst part? It
						didn't
						even tell me. I only realized when I opened the extensions panel to see why my theme was different. It uses
						the Open VSX
						marketplace, which causes compatibility gaps, but not warning the user feels like a letdown.
					</p>

					<p>
						Then I started coding. It feels like it doesn't automatically index the codebase in the background. Every
						time I
						started a new chat, it felt like it had to search the codebase from scratch. The agent would go "let me read
						the codebase to gather context", every single time.
					</p>

					<p>
						The agent's interaction with tools also felt a bit raw. I tried to get it to check some TypeScript errors,
						and
						it ran <code>npx tsc --noEmit</code> in the terminal. Same for Eslint. It works, sure, but I wished it could
						just tap into the
						language server directly.
					</p>

					<p>
						The browser agent relies heavily on executing JS for everything rather than
						interacting with the DOM directly via MCP.
					</p>

					<p>
						Another friction point: <strong>The lack of tabs for agents.</strong> It's difficult to switch conversations
						even if things are running in the background. It seems they want to push us towards the Agent Manager but
						that ruins context for me.
					</p>

					<h2 class="section-heading">The Good stuff</h2>
					<p>
						<strong>Google AI Pro plan</strong> limits are incredibly generous. I stopped worrying about
						"spending"
						credits. Do note that I got Google AI Pro plan for free through a promotion Google is running in India.
					</p>

					<h2 class="section-heading">The Hell yeah! stuff</h2>

					<h3 class="subsection-heading">1. Video Analysis for Testing</h3>
					<p>
						This was huge. I was working on some tricky CSS animations. In Cursor, I'd have to describe what's
						happening.
						The Antigravity browser agent just... analyzed the video recording of the browser session. It's something
						I'd desperately wanted in Cursor. Antigravity's browser agent works perfectly for this usecase.
					</p>

					<h3 class="subsection-heading">2. No "Modes"</h3>
					<p>
						I realized I've developed a subtle annoyance with Cursor's modes-switching to "Agent" to write, "Ask" to
						ask,
						"Plan" to plan and "Debug" to debug.
					</p>

					<p>
						In Antigravity, the agent just does what it's asked. I tell it to "Make a plan," and it creates a plan
						artifact.
						I can review it line-by-line, leave comments, and iterate right there. It feels organic. It doesn't feel
						like I'm
						jumping lines at the receptionist's desk.
					</p>

					<h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>

					<p>
						It's definitely rough around the edges. It feels like where Cursor was in Feb/March 2025. The onboarding
						needs love, and the UI for switching conversations is clunky.
						But the philosophy: generous limits, video analysis, and a mode-less workflow centered around artifacts is
						compelling.
					</p>

					<p>
						I'm not uninstalling Cursor just yet, but if Google's models improve context size, following instructions
						and the browser agent begging me for permission every 5 seconds, Antigravity might be a better option
						overall given the price point and the additional benefits like cloud storage, Gemini in emails, workspace
						etc.
						To keep me on Cursor, they could get rid of the modes and make the agent do what it's asked to do. Better
						pricing like a $40 plan with 1k requests would be great as well. I currently run out of the included 500
						requests in less than 2 weeks.
